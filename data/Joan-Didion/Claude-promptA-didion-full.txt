In the summer of 1965 I first arrived in Westlake, though I couldn't have told you precisely why. This seems an important distinction to make now, three years later, in light of what happened. The palm trees were already dying then, their fronds yellowing in the peculiar haze that settled over Montrose Avenue each afternoon around four, a combination of exhaust and marine layer that tasted vaguely metallic. I remember pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth on my first evening there, testing the air like an animal might. The streets glistened with something that wasn't quite rain. It never really rained in Westlake.

At night the city bloomed into an elaborate circuit board, red taillights streaming down the boulevards, green and yellow signals pulsing at intersections. From my window at the Westmont Hotel I could see through other windows: a woman applying lipstick, a man examining the label on a prescription bottle, two people arguing without sound. I wrote their dialogue on hotel stationery, fabricating lives that seemed more coherent than my own. This struck me as a reasonable occupation for someone twenty-two years old in a strange city. Everything seemed reasonable then.

The mornings took on a certain rhythm: the grinding of the elevator as it descended past my floor, the particular squeak of the newsstand vendor's cart as he arranged the day's papers, the smell of scorched coffee from the diner next door. I would watch the secretaries in their neat skirts and jackets hurry past the hotel entrance, their heels striking precise notes on the pavement. There was a kind of music to it all. I believed I could learn to play it.

Noise was constant in Westlake. Car horns, sirens, jackhammers breaking up sidewalks, the persistent bass from the nightclub three blocks away, radios tuned to different stations leaking from apartment windows like competing testimonies. The buses wheezed at their stops, hydraulic sighs that punctuated the hours. At the corner of Montrose and Fairview, a man sold flowers from plastic buckets, calling out the names of blossoms I'd never heard of in a language I didn't understand. I bought tulips once. They wilted before I reached my room.

The billboards changed weekly, enormous faces appearing and disappearing above the traffic, smiling down at us with pharmaceutical promises or invitations to television premieres. I began photographing them, creating a catalog of transient deities. The city seemed constructed of such ephemera—paper coffee cups, bus transfers, movie ticket stubs, receipts that faded in the sun, classified ads circled in pencil. These were our artifacts. They accumulated in my pockets, in my handbag, in the drawer of the nightstand. I kept them as evidence, though of what I wasn't sure.

It was in this city that I believed anything might happen, and for a while, that belief seemed justified. I attended gallery openings where the wine was cheap but the conversation aspired to something European and intellectual. I sat in the back of bookstores during poetry readings, watching how the light fell across strangers' profiles. I learned the names of streets and neighborhoods, pronouncing them like incantations: Silverlake, Echo Park, Los Feliz. Knowledge of geography constituted a kind of belonging. Or so I thought.

The office where I first worked occupied the fourteenth floor of the Meridian Building, though there was no thirteenth floor, so really it was the thirteenth. This seemed symbolic in ways I couldn't articulate. The elevator buttons skipped from 12 to 14, a collective agreement to avoid acknowledging what we all knew to be true. My desk faced a wall of windows that reflected our own office back at us when the sun hit a certain angle. Sometimes I couldn't tell if I was looking out or in. The carpet was a shade of blue that seemed designed to hide stains while simultaneously calling attention to itself.

In the mornings the women in the typing pool arrived together, as though they'd been delivered in a single shipment. They wore similar clothes and similar perfumes. They kept photographs on their desks—children, husbands, cats, vacation spots rendered generic by distance and exposure. They called me "college girl" though I rarely mentioned college. Perhaps it was something in the way I held my cigarette or the books I carried at lunch. Distinctions in that office were made and maintained with surgical precision.

The men moved differently through the space, leaning against doorframes, dropping into chairs in meetings, spreading papers across conference tables. They loosened their ties after five o'clock. They called secretaries by their first names and each other by their last. I was sent to take notes at their meetings, where they spoke in a shorthand of acronyms and references to conversations I hadn't been present for. I wrote everything down, transcribing their language as though it were a code I might eventually crack.

There were lunches at the circular restaurant atop the Crawford Building, where tables rotated slowly to provide a panoramic view of the city and the distant mountains beyond. The rotation was barely perceptible unless you watched the windows, which is what I did while editors and publicists discussed manuscripts and sales figures. I ordered what they ordered and laughed when they laughed. This seemed the most efficient way to proceed. Someone once told me I had "good instincts," which I understood to mean I had successfully hidden my bewilderment.

The parties began at nine and ended when they ended. They took place in apartments in buildings with doormen or houses in the hills with terraced gardens and pools illuminated from within. The same people appeared at different addresses, carrying bottles of wine or small bags of drugs. They kissed the air beside each other's faces. They complained about projects that never seemed to materialize. They referenced successes that occurred before I arrived. I stood at the edges of rooms, holding drinks that warmed in my hand, listening to people explain themselves to each other.

I moved through professional circles where everyone claimed to be writing a screenplay or finishing a novel or developing a concept for a new magazine. The particulars changed but the conversations remained static—the same anecdotes, the same grievances, the same predictions about who was finished in this town and who was about to break through. There was a veneer of camaraderie that thinned as the night progressed, revealing the competitive calculations beneath. I took careful notes on these dynamics, believing they constituted an education of sorts.

My first apartment was a sublet on Vanessa Street, a studio with windows that faced an air shaft. The previous tenant had left behind a fern that I couldn't bring myself to discard, though I had no idea how to care for it. It browned at the edges, then center, a slow death I witnessed with academic interest. The walls were so thin that I learned the patterns of my neighbors' lives—when they showered, argued, made love, watched television. I began to structure my own schedule in response, a silent choreography of strangers.

Later I moved to a one-bedroom on the third floor of a building called The Paramount, though there was nothing paramount about it except perhaps its proximity to the freeway. The constant sound of traffic became white noise, a oceanic roar that I only noticed when it occasionally abated in the earliest hours of morning. The apartment came furnished with heavy wooden pieces from another era. The closet smelled of someone else's perfume. At night I'd wake to the sound of the refrigerator cycling on and off, a mechanical heartbeat that kept me company.

The third place was a cottage behind a larger house on a street lined with pepper trees. It had a small porch where I placed a chair I never sat in. There was a rectangle of yard, mostly dirt with patches of stubborn grass. The landlady lived in the main house and watched from her window as I came and went. She watered her garden in the evenings, the spray from her hose catching the last light. Once she brought me a jar of homemade preserves that I couldn't identify by taste or appearance. I ate it anyway, spooning it directly from the jar while standing at the sink.

For a time these arrangements seemed to constitute a life. I had business cards printed with my name and the title "Editorial Assistant." I opened a bank account. I had my hair cut at a salon recommended by someone at work. I learned which bars served food late and which streets to avoid after certain hours. I sent postcards to friends back east describing Westlake as though it were exactly where I meant to be. The postcards featured palm trees silhouetted against impossibly pink skies. I began to believe my own descriptions.

What changed? Nothing dramatic. No single moment of revelation. Rather, a gradual accumulation of evidence that I was participating in a story that held no particular place for me. The editor who hired me left for another publishing house. The manuscript I'd been assigned to proofread was canceled. The man I'd been seeing moved to Seattle without a proper goodbye. These weren't tragedies. They were barely even disappointments. They were simply the mechanics of a place revealing itself to be exactly what it was: indifferent.

I began to notice how the light hit the buildings downtown—not romantically but harshly, exposing every stain and crack. The palm trees I'd once found exotic now appeared shabby and artificial, like props on an abandoned film set. The constant sound of sirens no longer registered as urban texture but as warnings. The billboards I'd photographed seemed less like cultural artifacts and more like symptoms of a collective delusion. Even the ocean, when I drove to see it, looked performative somehow, waves crashing with theatrical insistence.

The gallery openings I attended grew indistinguishable from one another—the same wines in plastic cups, the same conversations shouted over ambient music, the same artists explaining work that looked remarkably like work I'd seen the month before. I stopped taking notes. I stopped asking questions. I stood in corners watching people perform versions of themselves that seemed increasingly desperate. Or perhaps it was my perception that had changed. I couldn't tell anymore.

At the office, I found myself unable to sustain the fiction that the work mattered—the frantic deadlines, the meetings about meetings, the memos outlining procedures that would be obsolete within weeks. I watched my colleagues move through their days with what appeared to be purpose and conviction. They discussed marketing strategies and cover designs with an intensity that suggested consequence. I nodded and took notes and offered opinions when asked, but I felt as though I were watching a foreign film without subtitles.

The city itself seemed to reflect my disillusionment, or perhaps reveal what had been there all along. The streets after rain weren't romantic but treacherous, slick with oil and debris. The homeless encampments I passed on my way to work expanded weekly, blue tarps and shopping carts creating a parallel city within the city. The palm fronds that fell during windstorms remained on sidewalks for days, brown and desiccated. Even the quality of light changed in my perception—less golden, more artificial, like fluorescent bulbs mimicking sunlight.

My final apartment was a second-floor walk-up in a building that had once been something else—a hotel maybe, or offices, it was hard to tell. The conversion had been done cheaply and with minimal imagination. The ceilings were too high, the windows too small, the bathroom fixtures from different decades. I unpacked only what I needed immediately. The rest remained in boxes stacked against the wall, a temporary arrangement that lasted months. I bought no plants, hung no pictures. The impermanence was the point.

It happened on a Tuesday in March, though the season hardly mattered in a place where the weather performed only minor variations on a single theme. I was sitting at my desk, transcribing notes from a meeting about the summer catalog, when I found I could no longer read my own handwriting. The letters had become abstract, meaningless. I stared at the page, waiting for meaning to reassert itself. When it didn't, I put down my pen and walked out of the building. No one noticed.

I drove to the ocean because it seemed like the appropriate gesture, the kind of symbolic action a character in a film might take at such a moment. The beach was nearly empty, just a few solitary figures walking along the shoreline, a man with a metal detector sweeping the sand methodically. I sat in my car and watched the waves, trying to feel something commensurate with the apparent significance of what was happening to me. The breakdown, when it came, was quotidian—no dramatic collapse, just tears that arrived without warning and stopped the same way.

That night I began sorting my possessions into categories: keep, discard, undecided. The "keep" pile was small, the "discard" larger, the "undecided" largest of all. I worked methodically, without sentimentality. Books, clothes, kitchenware, the accumulation of three years—all of it suddenly negotiable. I called my landlord and gave notice. I called the office and said I had the flu. I called my mother and told her I was coming home for a while, though "home" was a place I hadn't lived in years. She asked no questions, which was either a kindness or an indication that she'd been expecting this call all along.

In the days that followed, I moved through the city with the heightened awareness of someone seeing a place for the last time. I noticed details I'd overlooked or forgotten—the particular shade of jacaranda blossoms against the sky, the way light filtered through the glass atrium of the public library, the precise choreography of a busy intersection at rush hour. I wasn't looking for reasons to stay. I was cataloging what I was willing to leave.

The goodbye party was held at a restaurant I'd never been to, organized by colleagues I'd never truly known. They gave me a leather-bound journal with a inscription wishing me success "on the east coast," though I hadn't specified where I was going. They reminisced about moments we'd supposedly shared—jokes, late nights at the office, happy hours—constructing a version of my time there that bore little resemblance to my experience. I smiled and thanked them and drank just enough to get through it.

The last night in the apartment I slept on a borrowed air mattress, my suitcases lined up by the door. The space echoed in a way it never had before. Through the window I could see the lights of the city, a constellation that had once seemed full of possibility and now appeared merely distant, like stars long extinguished whose light was only now reaching me. I felt no sadness, no regret, only a curious lightness that I mistook briefly for freedom before recognizing it as exhaustion.

In the morning I returned the keys to the landlord, who performed a cursory inspection before handing me a check for my security deposit, minus cleaning fees. The transaction took less than ten minutes. I drove to the airport with the windows down, the warm air rushing in, carrying the scents of the city—jasmine and exhaust, ocean salt and restaurant grease. At a stoplight, a man selling oranges from a shopping cart smiled and waved as though we were old friends. I waved back, a final exchange with a place that had never quite become mine.

What I know now that I didn't know then: leaving is not the same as escaping. The self follows, persistent as a shadow. Westlake wasn't the problem, nor was it ever the solution. It was merely the backdrop against which I enacted a particular version of my confusion, a geography that accommodated my uncertainties without resolving them. The mistake was in believing that a place could save you, or that fleeing it could accomplish the same.

Three years later, certain images persist with the clarity of fever dreams: the particular angle of light in my first apartment on winter mornings, the sound of palm fronds scraping against stucco in the wind, the taste of cheap wine at gallery openings, the precise hue of the ocean at sunset viewed from the Santa Monica pier. These aren't memories exactly, but something more fundamental—the sensory vocabulary of a time that shaped me in ways I'm still discovering. Westlake remains within me not as nostalgia but as evidence, the archaeological record of who I was becoming.

I sometimes see the city in films or photographs and experience a jolt of recognition followed by a curious detachment, as though identifying a place I've only read about rather than lived in. The geography remains accurate but the emotional topography has shifted, rendering the landscape simultaneously familiar and foreign. This, I suppose, is the final legacy of any place we've tried and failed to belong to—it becomes both ours and not ours, a territory we can map with precision but no longer inhabit.
