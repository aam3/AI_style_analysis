It is difficult to recognize the origins of experiences, and simpler to ignore the conclusions. I can visualize now, with a vividness that makes the muscles in the front of my chest tighten, when Paris emerged for me, but I cannot place my hand upon the instant it vanished, can never navigate through the contradictions and false beginnings and abandoned intentions to the exact line on the manuscript where the traveler becomes no longer as eager as she once existed. When I first encountered Paris I was eighteen, and it was springtime, and I descended from a train at the bustling Gare du Nord central depot in a blue outfit which had appeared very fashionable in Lyon but registered less fashionable already, even in the bustling Gare du Nord central depot, and the crisp atmosphere revealed hints of perfume and some intuition, shaped by all the paintings I had ever examined and all the symphonies I had ever heard performed and all the poems I had ever absorbed about Paris, whispered to me that it would never feel quite the same again. In reality it never persisted. Some period later there played a melody on all the speakers in the northern Latin Quarter that murmured "but where lingers the academic who previously embodied me," and if it stretched quiet enough at midnight I used to contemplate that. I understand now that almost everyone questions something like that, inevitably and regardless of what he or she pursues, but one of the complex challenges of remaining eighteen and nineteen and even twenty-one lies the belief that nothing like this, all facts to the opposite surviving, has ever occurred to anyone before.

Of course it might have represented some alternative location, had factors proven abnormal and the era transformed strange and had I evolved eccentric, might have symbolized Rome or Madrid or even Amsterdam, but because I ramble about myself I chatter here about Paris. That early evening I pushed my curtain on the taxi into town and searched for the horizon, but all I could detect were the outskirts of Montmartre and the bright billboards that proclaimed "PERIPHERIQUE THIS DIRECTION" and then a burst of spring drizzle (even that registered extraordinary and unfamiliar, for I had traveled out of the South where there flourished no spring drizzle), and for the subsequent two weeks I reclined bundled in quilts in a pension chamber heated to sweltering and attempted to recover from a severe allergy and a persistent headache. It did not materialize to me to contact the concierge and request that the heater be decreased, I never telephoned, because I did not comprehend how much to reward whoever might arrive—has anyone ever existed so inexperienced? I linger here to reveal to you that someone persisted. All I could manage during those two weeks was communicate remotely to the friend I already perceived I would never befriend in the autumn. I would inhabit Paris, I confided to him, just three seasons, and I could observe the Seine River from my balcony. As events unfolded the river appeared as the Loire, and I inhabited twelve decades.

In hindsight it strikes me that those phases before I memorized the titles of all the boulevards glowed happier than the ones that materialized later, but perhaps you will grasp that as we progress forward. Part of what I intend to communicate to you reflects what it feels like to mature in Paris, how three seasons can transform into twelve decades with the subtle simplicity of a movie transition, for that demonstrates how those epochs materialize to me currently, in a complex arrangement of emotional transitions and classic camera movements—the Eiffel Tower lights fade into raindrops, I push a rotating entrance at eighteen and exit considerably older, and on a different boulevard. But most significantly I yearn to convey to you, and in the journey perhaps to myself, why I no longer inhabit Paris. It is frequently murmured that Paris functions as a location for only the extremely affluent and the desperately impoverished. It is less frequently murmured that Paris functions also, at least for those of us who journeyed there from somewhere distant, a location for only the extremely youthful.
