It was from the marshy grove that bordered Blackwell Institute that the fever first arose, carried on the mists that hung perpetually about those tangled trees, seeping through cracks in the stone walls to claim its victims with merciless efficiency. Our dormitories were hastily transformed into sickrooms, with rows of pallid faces replacing the stern symmetry of our usual quarters, while Miss Hargreave moved between the beds with grim purpose, her ordinarily sharp voice now softened to whispers of comfort. The malady spread with such cruel swiftness that within a fortnight, half our number lay prostrate beneath thin blankets, and several had already been carried away in plain wooden boxes to the small cemetery behind the chapel.

In cruel paradox, beyond the windows that we were forbidden to open, spring had arrived in all its splendor; I observed the mockery of nature's renewal as brilliant green buds unfurled on every branch and wildflowers carpeted the distant meadows, all while death stalked our halls with impunity. The contrast between the dismal interior—heavy with the scent of medicines and illness—and the vibrant landscape beyond our walls seemed a taunt to those confined within, yet it stirred within me a most unexpected sentiment: freedom.

With most of the instructors occupied in nursing duties or themselves afflicted, those few of us who remained untouched by illness found ourselves largely unobserved; thus I discovered the small inlet where a fallen tree formed a natural bridge across the narrow stream, leading to a secluded bank overhung with willows, invisible from the main grounds of Blackwell. It was here that I began to meet with Margaret, a girl two years my senior who had previously been too occupied with her studies to take notice of a younger companion. How strange that amid such widespread suffering, I should experience a lightness of spirit unfamiliar to me during all my previous years at the institution; we would sit for hours with our feet dangling over the water, speaking of books and dreams while the afternoon sun filtered through the new leaves above.

Margaret possessed precisely the temperament that complemented my own—where I was given to flights of fancy, she brought practical wisdom; when I grew pensive, she knew how to draw me back with her quiet humor—and I found in her friendship a satisfaction that made bearable the grim circumstances that had fostered our alliance. As weeks passed and the epidemic maintained its grip on Blackwell, I discovered within myself a curious detachment from the tragedy unfolding in the main building; I noted with analytical coolness how our numbers diminished, yet felt myself removed from the grief that should naturally accompany such loss.

Instead, my attention fixed increasingly on the minute changes in the landscape—the precise shade of blue in a wild hyacinth, the pattern of ripples when a water strider skimmed across the stream's surface—and I savored each moment of unstructured time as a precious gift, one purchased at terrible cost, yet no less sweet for its dark origins.
